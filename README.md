# Weather-App

This is a small weather app I made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It uses the OpenWeather API to show temperature, humidity, wind speed, and an icon for the current weather in any city you search.

## How it works
- Type a city name in the search box
- Press Enter or click the search icon
- The app will fetch the weather data and show it with a nice icon

## Features
- Works on both desktop and mobile
- Simple, clean UI
- Weather icons change based on conditions

## How to run
Just open `index.html` in your browser.  
If you want to use it with your own API key:
1. Sign up at [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org/) (free)
2. Copy your API key
3. Replace it in `script.js` where it says `apiKey`
